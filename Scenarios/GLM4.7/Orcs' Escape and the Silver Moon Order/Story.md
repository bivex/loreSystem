Orc's Escape and the Silver Moon Order - Story

Mog stirred, as if someone had poured him over, dragged him to another skull and shattered his body to pieces.

I opened my eyes. Gorb was short, cut from rough gray stone, and the air smelled of raw hide, fat and something else — sharp, metallic. I tried to move, but my hands and legs were tied with thick ropes sinking into my skin.

Then I saw them.

Three orcs. Not those from children's tales, but real, living eyes with scars. They sat around the bonfire in the center of the cave, and their shadows danced across the walls performing some kind of devilish dance.

On the left, standing by the senseless fire with dead, mutant eyes, sat the huge green-skinned ogre with broken teeth. He mechanically sharpened the stone knife, the sound of which scraped hearing.

So I saw them.

Then the goblin came forward. He was small, but broad-shouldered, with rusty, coarse hair like pig bristles. Sometimes he even snorted, making wet, clucking sounds, scraping the ground with his guttural muttering about something in his barbaric dialect from which the bonfire shook.

But my gaze fixed on the third one. He sat opposite me, back to the fire, so that only the light reflected in his two small yellow, disease-like eyes. He didn't move. He just watched me.

On the left, standing by the fire, the huge green-skinned ogre with broken teeth mechanically honed his stone knife, the scraping of which grated on hearing.

The second, smaller but broader in the shoulders, with red, coarse, wiry hair like a wire, smelling of rotting flesh, dripping wet, clucking sounds. Sometimes he even broke and pounded the ground with his hoof, swearing in his guttural dialect at what the flames made the bonfire tremble.

But my gaze was drawn to the third. He sat opposite me, back to the fire, so only the light reflected in his two small yellow, disease-like eyes. He didn't move. He just watched me.

Urgent stopped sharpening the knife. The whistling, interrupted only by the hoarse crunch of the bones of the dead Red, began to wheeze into my ears.

— Woke up, — the one sitting across from me croaked. His voice sounded like the grinding of dead ghouls — probably strong.

He lunged forward, seizing the headless body with his hand, and struck it with his palm.

— Where to, — the Red one spat, snapping the skull in two.

— Well then, — said the goblin, and grinned at his companions. — We're hungry.

The orcs growled, and I understood that the worst thing that could happen to me today was not what I woke up to. And what I, apparently, would no longer sleep.

I stood motionless, expecting a blow, but no blow followed.

— What's wrong? — the huge green ogre's yellow eyes narrowed. — Can't catch, huh?

He stood up, blocking the light of the bonfire with his massive body, and the air around me became thick, filled with the suffocating smell of rotting corpse and old blood.

I tried to step back, but the ropes only bit into my skin. I was helpless, like a worm on a hook.

The Urgent seized me by the chest with his paw the size of a soup ladle and slammed me to the ground. My knees trembled, buckling, but he didn't let me fall, holding me in the air like a rag doll.

— Where to, — croaked the Red one, spitting bone on the ground. — Celebration is just beginning.

The third orc, Grak, didn't rush with me from the yellow eyes. He slowly dragged himself out of a hole in the ground, apparently not of one century of rustiness. The descent was dark, covered with a thick layer of soot and probably not one color of rust. I struggled instinctively, expecting a strike, but it didn't come.

The Urgent stepped forward, thrusting his head out of the crypt-like hole in front of him, and the green eyes narrowed. — Do you think you can leave?

I looked him straight in the eye. — How so? — I asked, raising my eyebrows.

— Run, — said Grak.

I looked around. The exit was visible beyond their backs — a narrow crack in the rock where the pale light of the moon barely penetrated. Only about ten meters. But between me and freedom stood three walls of meat and darkness.

Two. My legs, exhausted from the bindings, could barely listen.

Three. The Red one was already bracing on one leg like a beast before a jump.

Adrenaline struck my blood hot. I couldn't just stand there.

I squeezed my hands into fists, ignoring the pain, and started climbing faster, not paying attention to the thorns. The rock walls were covered in moss and slime, but the orcs had lived here long enough to wear paths into them.

Suddenly, from behind the orcs, a female figure emerged. Light, graceful, with two short swords at her hips. She approached the Red one, who was still trying to get up, and with one precise thrust to the neck, sent him into eternity.

The Red one fell. The orc behind him, having already gotten up, threw himself at her with his full weight, chain-whipping her legs, and pinned her to the ground.

— Ah, damn, — I thought to myself. — Three on one.

She moved with blinding speed. Not like the others. She drew her swords from the scabbards in a blur of motion, and in one precise strike, cut the Red one's throat. The big orc's yellow eyes bulged. He tried to inhale, but only a wet gurgle escaped.

She didn't stop. In the same motion, she drew a second blade and thrust it into the smaller goblin's stomach. He didn't even scream.

Then she spun and kicked the Urgent's knee. Bone crunched with a sickening sound, and the ogre howled, losing balance. Before he could recover, both blades crossed at his neck and his head rolled away, staring with surprise at something he would never see.

Only I remained.

The huge ogre's chest collapsed, crushing scattered rocks with his fall. A cloud of dust rose, momentarily obscuring the moonlight. The green light of the exit vanished.

I froze. Should I run? But where to?

The Urgent's hand lay beside his head, still holding the stone knife. The stone that had cut open his back in the crypt. I tried to reach it, but he wasn't breathing anymore.

I heard a heavy exhale behind me.

— Back up, — croaked the Red one's voice from somewhere in the dark. — Wait a bit.

His voice sounded like grinding stone. — What? — he wheezed.

— Give me five breaths, — said the Red one's companion, whose lips stretched in a hateful smile, revealing broken teeth. — If you last, you live. If not...

The orc with the broken nose pointed at me. — Ready? — he grunted.

I held my breath.

The Red one roared, shattering the silence of the cavern. The smaller goblin, having recovered, crouched by the fire, sharpening his weapon.

Three. I looked up. To the exit, visible through the narrow crack as a slit in a rock. Only ten meters away. But between me and freedom stood three walls of meat and darkness.

One. My legs, numb from the ropes, barely listened.

Two. The Red one was already bracing, ready to spring.

Three. The goblin, having recovered, crouched by the fire.

The Red one roared again. The goblin sprang at me with a grunt.

I thought I was done.

Adrenaline crashed through my veins. I threw myself sideways toward the crack, sliding across the rough floor, scraping skin from my shoulders.

A massive hand caught my ankle. The Red one's grip was like iron. He pulled me back.

I twisted, desperate, and sank my teeth into his hand. He didn't even flinch.

— Don't struggle, croaked the huge one from somewhere ahead. — You're not getting away.

The massive orc's chest heaved. He was already there.

He knew the terrain. He was gathering to block my path to the summit.

— Retreat, — he whistled, pointing his finger at the gap in the rocks through which I'd tried to escape. — The cliff. You'd be dead before you reach it.

I weighed my options. Running toward him was suicide. Running the other way — into the waiting darkness of the tunnels.

Suddenly, from the direction where the Red one stood, a heavy thump echoed. Rock crunched under boots.

Another figure emerged. Tall, straight, two-legged, wearing dark leather armor that shimmered with silver in the moonlight.

— You're alive? — I whispered to myself, surprised.

— Who are you? — the stranger grunted, drawing a sword and pointing it at my captor.

The Red one stepped forward, face contorted with rage. — You're not taking him, orc!

The stranger didn't respond. He simply held his ground, sword level.

— Who are you? — the Red one roared. — That was my catch!

— It was your catch, the stranger replied calmly. — And I'm buying it.

— How much? — asked the Red one.

— Nothing, — said the stranger, stepping aside.

The Red one's jaw dropped. He stood there, mouth open, at a total loss.

The stranger walked to me, ignoring the orcs completely, and grabbed my arm, pulling me to my feet.

I was too stunned to react.

— Human? — croaked the Red one. — Your blood is worth more.

— What? — I asked, recovering.

— Who are you? — he asked the stranger, ignoring me, turning to face him.

— This was not a simple orc, — he said seriously. — This was a Chieftain of the Northern Tribe. And now that he's gone, his tribe will wake up. They will hunt his killer. They will track his scent. And they will come here.

I felt cold running down my spine. I tried to understand what was happening behind me. The bad thing, I realized, was just beginning.

— What do we do? — I asked.

— Run, — he said. — And fast. Because they're already coming.

He turned and walked back the way he'd come, along the edge of the abyss, on the solid ground the orcs couldn't follow.

I looked at the moon in the sky above. A narrow slit of pale light appeared in the rocks — the entrance to the cave. Only twenty meters. If the Chieftain gets there before me, he'll simply throw me down into the abyss. I can't fight.

I gathered my remaining strength and started climbing faster, ignoring the pain in my fingers, slipping on the slippery moss.

From above, the sound of metal on stone echoed. He was already there.

I exhaled and grabbed the rim, pulling myself up with a jerk, barely making it.

I looked up. To the campfire where they sat. His yellow eyes had narrowed.

He didn't move toward the danger. He just looked down at his fallen companions, and then slowly raised his head and looked at me. In his yellow eyes there was no anger. There was only cold, professional interest.

He knew the area. He was gathering to cut off my path to the peak.

— Retreat, — he whistled, pointing his finger at the gap in the rocks through which I'd tried to escape. — The cliff. You'd be dead before you reach it.

I weighed my options. Running toward him was suicide. Running the other way — into the waiting darkness of the tunnels.

Suddenly, from the direction where the Red one stood, a heavy thump echoed. Rock crunched under boots.

Another figure emerged. Tall, straight, two-legged, wearing dark leather armor that shimmered with silver in the moonlight.

He didn't move toward the danger. He just looked down at his fallen companions, and then slowly raised his head and looked at me. In his yellow eyes there was no anger. There was only cold, professional interest.

He knew the area. He was gathering to cut off my path to the peak.

He didn't risk the dangerous loose slide. Instead, he turned and ran along the edge of the breach, above, on the hard ground.

I froze. And my breathing stopped.

The forest rumbled with the heavy footsteps of a thousand orcs, waking to avenge. And the night was filled with their voices.

I looked at the knife in the dead orc's hand. Then at their backs.

— I'm with you, — I said, rising and wiping blood from my face.

— You're with us? — the Red one asked, stepping toward us, closing the distance. — Or are you against us?

— I am with you, — I said, looking from one to the other. — I've paid for it.

From behind them, a heavy bestial breath escaped, breaking the tense silence. Sharp, predatory, forcing the darkness to vibrate. A siren howled from the forest, sharp and prolonged, forcing my eardrums to contract, making me wince. Did the deaf or stupid not hear it?

The Chieftain turned slowly toward the stranger. He was no longer calm. He had drawn his battle-axe, which he swung in a testing motion, making the air buzz. Then he threw himself forward with his full weight, clubbing the stranger in the knee, and while he doubled over, grabbed him by the throat and slammed him into the ground.

— No! — the stranger screamed, deflecting the Red one's blow with his forearm. — You won't kill him either.

But it was too late. The Red one had already joined his two companions from behind, surrounding the stranger three against one.

I could have escaped. The path into the forest was open. But something held me in place. Perhaps fear. Perhaps the madness of confronting three monsters alone had broken something inside me.

Perhaps the realization that if the orcs kill the stranger, they'll come back for me. That I've been marked as prey, and the hunt isn't over.

I stood and watched the stranger struggle. He didn't draw a weapon. He simply met their eyes with calm acceptance.

— Is that all? — he asked calmly. — Just the three of you?

— Not just three, — growled the Red one. — An army is coming.

— An army? — the stranger raised his eyebrows. — Who leads it?

— North, — the Red one spat, pointing. — The Chieftain's tribe wakes tonight. And they will hunt until they've slaughtered every last one of us.

The stranger's composure cracked. He drew his sword and swung at the nearest orc. Metal rang.

— Surrender, — I said, trying to stop this. — They'll kill you too.

The stranger laughed. A dry, humorless sound. — Kill me? Three orcs?

He didn't even seem to be trying. The orc's blade simply bounced off his armor.

The Red one swung his axe. The stranger moved faster than I could follow. His sword flashed, and the Red one's chest opened, spilling black blood that steamed in the cold air.

The two orcs roared together and charged.

The stranger held his ground. I watched them crash into him like an avalanche.

I closed my eyes and waited for death.

It didn't come.

When I opened my eyes, the stranger stood alone. Three bodies lay around him. The Red one's chest was a ruin. The goblin's stomach was cut open. The Urgent's neck was a bloody ruin.

The stranger turned to me. I saw blood on his face.

— You can run, — he said. — They'll need time to gather the others.

I ran.

I ran through the narrow gap in the rocks, into the night forest, heading away from the direction where the tribe would wake.

I ran until my lungs burned and my legs threatened to give out. I ran until the moon vanished behind the trees and only the stars watched me from the black sky.

I ran until I found a shelter. A small cave, hidden behind thick bushes. I crawled inside, curling into a ball, and held my breath, waiting for my heart to stop pounding so loudly.

— You're alive? — the stranger's voice called from somewhere above.

I looked up. He stood at the entrance, blood running down his face, wiping his swords on dead bodies' clothes.

— How so? — I rasped, trying to inhale.

The stranger stared. His swords were directed at us, but he didn't move. — Can't catch, huh?

— Human blood is worth more, — he answered, wiping the sweat from his brow. — Your blood is worth more.

— What? — I asked, recovering.

— Who are you? — he asked the stranger, ignoring me, turning to face him.

— This was not a simple raider, — he said seriously. — This was a Chieftain of the Northern Tribe. A shaman who walks between worlds. And now that he's gone, his tribe will wake up. They will hunt his killer. They will track his scent. And they will come here.

I felt cold running down my spine. I tried to understand what was happening behind me. The bad thing, I realized, was just beginning.

Go ahead
