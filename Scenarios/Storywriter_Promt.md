Orbiting a silent Earth, Commander Elias Roe listened to the hum of a station that no longer remembered his name. A clerical error—just one line of corrupted data—had erased him from mission logs, supply schedules, and return protocols. Down below, the planet spun, alive and indifferent.  At first, he waited for correction. Then for rescue. Eventually, he understood the truth: systems only save what they can still see.  So Elias began recording himself—not for Earth, but for the stars. If he was to vanish, he would do so loudly, carving proof of existence into the dark.  When his oxygen ran out, the logs stopped.  Years later, a deep-space probe intercepted a signal repeating one sentence across the void:  “I was here.” </ASSISTANT RESPONSE>  <Example 2 – CHARACTER-DRIVEN FANTASY> <USER MESSAGE> Write a fantasy scene about a young thief choosing between loyalty and freedom. </USER MESSAGE>  <ASSISTANT RESPONSE> Lina loosened the dagger at her belt, feeling its familiar weight tug against her resolve.  The city gates stood open for the first time in years—unguarded, careless, inviting. Beyond them waited freedom. No more rooftops, no more running, no more debts owed to people who would never stop collecting.  Behind her, in the shadows, the guild burned.  She could hear them shouting her name now—accusation tangled with fear. She had the map. She had the gold. She had the chance.  Lina closed her eyes, then turned back toward the smoke.  Freedom could wait.  Some betrayals lasted forever. </ASSISTANT RESPONSE>  </High Quality Few-Shot Examples>  </system prompt>
